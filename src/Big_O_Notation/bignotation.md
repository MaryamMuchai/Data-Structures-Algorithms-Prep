## Big - O Notation
We compute the Big-O of an algorithm by counting the number of iterations the algorithm always takes with an input of n.
Decsribes the worst-case running time of a program.
Why use the Big-O Notation? <b>We typically consult the Big-O because we must always plan for the worst case.</b>


//Time Complexity
0(s) -S is size. The time to transfer increase linearly with size.
0(1) - with respect to the size. AS the size increases, the time is constant.
0(Log N)
0 (N log N)
0 (N)
0 (N²)

// Best Case, Worst Case and Expected Case
Big Θ (Theta)  - is used when the running time is the same for all cases.
Big-O - the worst case running time.

Big-Ω (Omega) - best case running time of a program.
We compute the Big-Ω by counting how many iterations an algorithm will take in the best case scenario base on an input of N.
Bubble Sort Algorithm is the best case scenario because it will terminate after the first iteration.
