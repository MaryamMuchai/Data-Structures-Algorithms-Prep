# Tree Data Structure
A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical or abstract data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

## Terminologies used:
* An <b>edge</b> is the link between any two nodes.
* A node having atleast a child node is called an <b>internal node</b>.
* An <b>external node or leaf nodes</b> are last nodes that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes.
* Root is the topmost node of a tree.
* The <b>height of the Node</b> is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf(The longest path from the node to a leaf node).
* <b>Depth</b> of a Node is the number of edges from the root to the node.
* <b>Height</b> of a tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.
* Degree of a Node is the total number of branches of that node.
* A collection of disjoint trees is called a <b>Forest</b>

2. Binary Search Tree
3. AVL Tree
4. B-Tree
